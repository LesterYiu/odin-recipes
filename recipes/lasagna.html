        <!--Description-->
            <div class="recipes"><p>Ive made this lasagna for various categories of humans since my mom first scribbled it down for me: men, women, democrats, republicans, scholars, and foreign dignitaries.</p>
            <p>I even donated two pans to a charity auction once. The overwhelming consensus has always been that its "The Best Lasagna Ever," which is precisely what Ive been trying to tell you turkeys.</p>
            <p>So lets get started!</p></div>

                            <li>1 lb. hot breakfast sausage</li>
                            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

                            <li>2 cans (6 ounce) tomato paste</li>
                            <li>2 tbsp. dried pasley</li>
                            <li>2 tbsp. dried basil</li>
                            <li>2 1/2 tsp. salt</li>

                            <li>2 whole beaten eggs</li>
                            <li>1/2 c. grated (not shredded) Parmesan cheese</li>
                            <li>1 tbsp. olive olive</li>
                            <li>1 package (10 ounce) lasagna noodles</li>
                            <li>1 lb. sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
                        </div>
                    </ul>
                <h3 class="sectiontext">Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <div class="recipetext">
                            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.</li>
                            <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” (not overly cooked). Drain.</li>
                            <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
                            <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.</li>
                            <li>In a skillet, combine 1 1/2 pounds ground beef, 1 pound hot breakfast sausage, and 2 cloves minced garlic.Cook until brown.</li>
                            <li>After that, add two 14.5-oz cans of whole tomatoes, two 6-oz cans of tomato paste. 2 tablespoons of dried parsley flakes, 2 tablespoons dried basil. And 1 teaspoon salt</li>
                            <li>Mix together thoroughly and simmer, uncovered, about 45 minutes</li>
                            <li>In the meantime, boil a 10-oz package of lasagna noodles. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to the water, as well as 1 tablespoon olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking. Cook the noodles "al dente" so they’ll still have quite a bite to them. When they’re finished cooking, drain, rinse with cool water, and lay the noodles flat on a sheet of aluminum foil. That way, they’ll be easier to handle later.</li>
                            <li>While the meat mixture and noodles are cooking, mix 3 cups lowfat cottage cheese in a bowl with 2 beaten eggs. IMPORTANT: If the thought of cottage cheese makes you want to run out of the house, take heart: you won’t even know it’s there. Ladd wouldn’t touch cottage cheese with a ten foot pole, yet he loved this lasagna so much…he married me.</li>
                            <li>To the cottage cheese, add 1/2 cup Kraft Parmesan Cheese…</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes, and 1 teaspoon salt.Mix together well.</li>
                            <li>Now, go ahead and build your assembly line: meat mixture, 1 pound sliced mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese mixture, and cooked lasagna noodles.</li>
                            <li>Let the assembly begin! Lay four cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of the pan, overlapping as you go.Spread half of the cottage cheese mixture evenly over the noodles</li>
                            <li>Then lay 1/2 pound of mozzarella cheese slices on top of the cottage cheese mixture. This particular brand of cheese was cut very thin, so I had to double up the slices to make 1/2 pound. Don’t let this throw you off—some brands are cut thicker, and would only require a single layer of slices. NOTE: I prefer sliced mozzarella, but you can certainly use grated mozzarella if necessary.</li>
                            <li>With the spoon, make a line through the middle of the meat mixture so you’ll distribute it evenly.Spread a little less than half of the meat mixture over the mozzarella cheese slice until it’s evenly distributed.Now it’s time to repeat the process! Add another layer of four lasagna noodles. And finish with the rest of the meat mixture.</li>
                            <li>Then top the cottage cheese mixture with another 1/2 pound of mozzarella.</li>
                            <li>Top with a pretty generous layer. Now pop it in a 350-degree oven for 20-30 minutes, until hot and bubbly. (Alternately, you could cover and freeze it, unbaked, at this point. OR cover and refrigerate, unbaked, for up to two days before baking.)</li>
